# visual_cryptography
A Python implementation of visual cryptography for grayscale and color images leveraging halftoning techniques. It employs a modular pipeline—powered by dedicated Encrypt, Decrypt, and HalftoneConverter classes—to generate visually encoded shares that are individually indecipherable but reconstruct the original image when overlaid. 

Simple usage examples are provided in the main.py file. Furthermore, demo images can be found in the output folder.
